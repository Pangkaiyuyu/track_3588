2023.09-2024.12 XX Multi-core Heterogeneous Intelligent Information Processing Technology (JKW Project, Million-level, Main responsible person)
Project Background: The accuracy of target tracking decreases in occluded scenarios. The target tracking algorithm introducing neural networks has low deployment efficiency and insufficient real-time performance
Project content: (1) Propose a deep feature channel screening mechanism based on spatio-temporal correlation to improve the semi-occluded problem in target tracking, targeting semi-occluded datasets
The tracking accuracy has been improved by more than 10% compared with the original CSR tracking algorithm
(2) Propose a refined adaptation scheme for NPU in CNN networks, perform basic operator fusion and INT8 quantization, screen and replace hardware-friendly operators, and increase the efficiency of deep feature extraction by 40% under the same input
(3) Build a C++ full-link project for video stream transmission, tracking and display, establish multi-threading and data protection on the CPU, and upgrade the GPU
Image preprocessing is carried out using the OpenCL library, and a high-utilization CNN feature extraction network is deployed on the NPU to achieve an FPS greater than 40
(4) Achievements: The project was successfully concluded and entered the second phase of pre-research. The RKNNRT development process was established, and the hardware deployment work for multiple related projects was assisted. The project was awarded the 2024 scientific research Honor Prize
